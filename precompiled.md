This is the first full release of the game, currently **Linux only**!

Avoid asteroids and shoot crystals to gain score. Move forward with SPACE, rotate your ship with WASD, and shoot with Q.

## How to *run the compiled project*:
You have downloaded the compiled project.
- Modify your keyboard settings: increase repeat rate and decrease repeat delay as much as possible
  - You can skip this, but input will be much less responsive
- Decrease your terminal text size (`Ctrl` + `-`) to fit the engine's resolution
- In the project directory, run `./main`
  - If this doesn't work for whatever reason, please file an issue and try building from the source code in the release
